# Wallappos


Please run this by choosing "Wallpappos.xcworkspace" instead of "Wallpappos.xcodeproj"
If there is any error that avoid you from running, check Podfile and do "pod install" to install all of the Pods plugin needed.

Thank you for your consideration and I am looking forward to hear back from you soon.
